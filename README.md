# Anemia and Hospitalization in Peritoneal Dialysis

This repository contains the code for a research project on the relationship between anemia and hospitalization in peritoneal dialysis patients.

## Project Description

The project aims to analyze the prevalence of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis and its impact on hospitalization rates. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, time trend analysis, and survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains two main Python files:

1. `AnemiaLevante.py`: This file contains all the functions used in the data analysis process, including data import, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

2. `Anemia_levanteDP.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook uses the functions defined in `AnemiaLevante.py` to perform the data analysis.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Anemia_levanteDP.ipynb`.
